# Project Title

Insight Data Engineering Challenge: EDGAR 

# Introduction

Many investors, researchers, journalists and others use the Securities and Exchange Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system to retrieve financial documents, whether they are doing a deep dive into a particular company's financials or learning new information that a company has revealed through their filings. 

The task is to build a pipeline to ingest that stream of data and calculate how long a particular user spends on EDGAR during a visit and how many documents that user requests during the session. 

# Challenge Link

For more details see the challenge page

https://github.com/InsightDataScience/edgar-analytics

# Prerequisites

I developed and tested in Python 3.6.3
I am importing two Python modules:
- import datetime
- import sys

#  Input Output Files

My program expects two input files (See the section, "Repo directory structure", for details on where these files should be located):

* `log.csv`: EDGAR weblog data inside `./input`
* `inactivity_period.txt`: Holds a single value denoting the period of inactivity that should be used to identify when a user session is over, file should be inside `./input`

It creates one output file inside `./output`:
* `sessionization.txt`


# Source Files
Source files are inside the `./src`
* `sessionization.py` : This includes the main
* `my_functions_classes.py` : This includes the functions and classes

# How to run
Run the shell script named `./run.sh` in the top-most directory.
Inside of the `./run.sh`, we have the following line:

python ./src/sessionization.py ./input/log.csv ./input/inactivity_period.txt ./output/sessionization.txt

# Assumptions and Preffered Actions

Some assumptions and preferred actions in case of errors in the input files:

- Due to some potential errors in the data file, some requests rows might not have the right format. In these cases, I will print out a warning to the screen and opt to skip that row and print a warning to the user
    - rows might not be in chronological order --> Print 'Skipped Row - Chronological Error ...'
    - rows might have missing values --> Print 'Skipped Row - Missing field:'
    - rows with invalid date and time --> Print 'Skipped Row - date/time format error:'
    - etc.

- If there is an error within the header row of the log file, an exception is raised and user is warned to check the first row of the file
- Missing input files: Warning to the user -->
- invalid inactivity duration: -->Exception: not a valid inactivity duration. Check the inactivity_filename, valid range: [1,2, .. 86400]
- etc.

- I also assume a simple time zone as we are told not to care about the time zone field.

- Challenge suggests us to focus on 6 fields, ip, date, time, cik, accession and extention: But I believe the fieldsa cik, accession and extnetions have no effect as long as they are there. Becasue, the challenge does not care about uniquness while counting the number of requests. These three fields can be used for idetifty unique documents/webpages. Hence in the code, they are not being used.



# Algorithm and Data Structures

Needed data structures
I need the following data structures:
ActiveSessions: A dictionary for keeping active sessions where the keys are IDs
Each element in ActiveSessions is a Session object
A Session object has the following attributes:
- moment of the first request FR
- moment of the last request
- request counter
- line number
- session duration
- sort method __lt__
- ID
- print method __str__
FinishedSession: This is a list of Sessions that are just popped from the ActiveSessions. We need to sort the items in this list according to their moments and line numbers
SortedSessions: Sorted version of the FinishedSession to be written to the output file

# Would have been nice to have

In the current form, the output file is opened once and closed once. But I imagine that, for a big input file it might be better to to open and close it every so many lines and event get a back up. Or better create smaller multiple output files.

It would have been also very useful to have written the code such that, the code can run from the point it crashed, next time it is run.(If the user wants to continue to append tot he already processed results, not want to process them again). This is useful, as sometimes, we want to pause/exit a program and restart later on.

# Test Cases

Information regarding test cases I think about. The input / output files for the test cases are within folder insight_testsuite. test_1 is the one given by the challenge

- TEST CASES
'OK' means the output matches what I would expect.

1)  folder name: test_1:  Given by the challenge itself - OK
2)  folder name: test_2:  Row entries are NOT in chronological order - OK
3)  folder name: test_3:  Empty log file - OK
4)  folder name: test_4:  Header row is there but no requests
5)  folder name: test_5:  Try rows that all come at the same time - OK
6)  folder name: test_6:  Try inactivity_duration to be 1 sec. - OK PS: the result makes sense to me but insight test fails ??
7)  folder name: test_7:  Try inactivity_duration to be <= 0 sec. - OK
8)  folder name: test_8:  Try inactivity_duration to be > 86400 sec. -OK

9)  folder name: test_9:  Try with consecutive identical rows - OK
10) folder name: test_10: Try with a single request - OK
11) folder name: test_11: Try inactivity_duration to be 100 sec. - OK
12) folder name: test_12: Somewhat convoluted case of rows - OK

13) folder name: test_13: inactivity_period.txt is missing - OK
14) folder name: test_14: log.csv is missing - OK


# How to test
 
Run the shell script named `./run_tests.sh` in the top-most directory. This will rn through all test-cases. You can verify the results by checking the output files or error messages.

## Testing the directory structure and output format

Challange provided a test script called `run_tests.sh` in the `insight_testsuite` folder.

The tests are stored simply as text files under the `insight_testsuite/tests` folder. Each test have a separate folder with an `input` folder for `inactivity_period.txt` and `log.csv` and an `output` folder for `sessionization.txt`.

You can run the test with the following command from within the `insight_testsuite` folder:

insight_testsuite~$ ./run_tests.sh 

On a failed test, the output of `run_tests.sh` should look like:

[FAIL]: test_1
[Thu Mar 30 16:28:01 PDT 2017] 0 of 1 tests passed

On success:

[PASS]: test_1
[Thu Mar 30 16:25:57 PDT 2017] 1 of 1 tests passed

# Example

Suppose your input files contained only the following few lines. Note that the fields we are interested in are in **bold** below but will not be like that in the input file. There's also an extra newline between records below, but the input file won't have that.

**`inactivity_period.txt`**
> **2**

**`log.csv`**
