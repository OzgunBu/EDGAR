\f0\fs22 \cf0 \CocoaLigature0 This document has two parts:\
\
- PART 1: Explantion of the code\
- PART 2: Explanation of the test cases\
\

==============\
FILES\
\
This file has necessary functions and class definitions for sessionization.py\
list of functions and class: \
\
def reading_row(row_str):\
\
def strip_date_time(date_str,time_str):\
\
def strip_date_time(date_str,time_str):\

class Session(object):\
\
==================\
Some assumptions and preferred actions in case of errors in the input files:\
\
- Due to some potential errors in the data file, some rows might not have the right format. In these cases, I will print out a warning to the screen and opt to skip that row.\
- Some foreseen errors:\
    - rows might not be in chronological order\
    - rows might have missing values\
- Missing input files: Warning to the user\
- Empty input files\
\
\
- I also assume a simple time zone as we are told not to care about the time zone field.\
\
- If in?? is less than 1, I will set it to 1.\
- If in?? is greater than max , I will set it to max.\
\
- output file to be written every so many lines maybe \

#cik = words[4] # any request (not necessarily unique) is counted as one, so I conclude that we do not need these fields\
#accession = words[5] # any request (not necessarily unique) is counted as one, so I conclude that we do not need these fields\
#extention = words[6] # any request (not necessarily unique) is counted as one, so I conclude that we do not need these fields\cf0 \

print('Skipped Row - date/time format error:',row_str) \
('Skipped Row - Missing field:',row_str)\
\
==================\
\
\
Needed data structures\
I need the following data structures:\
ActiveSessions: A dictionary for keeping active sessions where the keys are IDs\
Each element in ActiveSessions is a Session object\
A Session object has the following attributes:\
- moment of the first request FR\
- moment of the last request\
- request counter\
- line number\
- session duration\
- sort method __lt__\
- ID\
- print method __str__\
FinishedSession: This is a list of Sessions that are just popped from the ActiveSessions. We need to sort the items in this list according to their moments and line numbers\
SortedSessions: Sorted version of the FinishedSession to be written to the output file\
\
===================\
\
\
Information regarding test cases I think about. The input / output files for the test cases are within folder insight_testsuite. test_1 is the one given by the challenge\
\
- TEST CASES\
\
'OK' means the output matches what I would expect.\
\
1)  folder name: test_1:  Given by the challenge itself - OK\
2)  folder name: test_2:  Row entries are NOT in chronological order - OK\
3)  folder name: test_3:  Empty log file - OK\
4)  folder name: test_4:  Header row is there but no requests\
5)  folder name: test_5:  Try rows that all come at the same time - OK\
6)  folder name: test_6:  Try inactivity_duration to be 1 sec. - OK PS: the result makes sense to me but insight test fails ??\
7)  folder name: test_7:  Try inactivity_duration to be <= 0 sec. - OK\
8)  folder name: test_8:  Try inactivity_duration to be > 86400 sec. -OK\
\
9)  folder name: test_9:  Try with consecutive identical rows - OK\
10) folder name: test_10: Try with a single request - OK\
11) folder name: test_11: Try inactivity_duration to be 100 sec. - OK\
12) folder name: test_12: Somewhat convoluted case of rows - OK\
\
13) folder name: test_13: inactivity_period.txt is missing - OK\
14) folder name: test_14: log.csv is missing - OK\
